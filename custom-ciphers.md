# Choosing a Preferred Cipher Suite for your HTTPS Application
{: #choosing-a-preferred-cipher-suite-for-your-https-application}

Cipher algorithms help the IBMÂ© Cloud Load Balancer form secure connections with its HTTP clients. IBM offers a suite of approved ciphers for you to choose from, so that you secure the communication between your load balancer and your clients.

To choose a preferred cipher suite for an existing load balancer:

1. Access the Cipher table from the **Protocols** tab. 

	There must be at least one existing HTTPS protocol. 
	{: note}

2. Click **Edit** to enable editing, and select (or unselect) the required ciphers.

3. When you're dobne, click **Save** to save your changes.

	If you defined a HTTPS protocol when creating your load balancer, it will have all ciphers in the suite enabled. The selection of a particular set of ciphers can be done only after the load balancer is provisioned.

	For a list of supported ciphers, refer to [SSL Offload](/docs/infrastructure/loadbalancer-service?topic=loadbalancer-service-ssl-offload-with-ibm-cloud-load-balancer).
